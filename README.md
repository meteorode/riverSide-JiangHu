## 江湖夜雨

「霭霭停云，濛濛时雨」

## structure

- Music
  * .band files created by Garage Band and @author by @meteorode  
- Swift Projects
  - assets
    * Images, icons, etc, generated by [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com)
  - code
    * pure Swift
  - data
    * scripts and other data, see [principle](#principle) for details.
  - docs

### principle

- using [.lean](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/builtintypes.html) as script file
- using SwiftUI to draw UI
- using XCode to manage assets, data, etc.
- using CoreData to parse the data
- using CoreML to generate contents
- using MidJourney to generate images
- using Reigns like swipe to make choices.
- using huggingface to train scripts from wuxia novels
  * at version 0.1, We'll set scripts manually
  * using supervised RL to train the model
- using [16Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/) and two Wuxia attributes (royalty and kind) to define persona.
  * check [JiangHu@Hyperion](https://github.com/meteorode/Hyperion-Reloaded/tree/master/Jiang%20Hu) for details.

### mvScript

#### Intro

// mvScript is short for melodyVerse Script

-   mvScript is somehow like basic, our syntax is like this:
    *   define constants and marco in $yourname.h
    *   write command in .md file with markdown syntax
    *   in JiangHu, we'll first support those commands:
        -   $name **move to** [loc]
        -   $name **talk to** $name
        -   $name **say** [sth]
        -   $name **meet** $name
        -   $name **like** $name
        -   $name **love** $name
        -   $name **engage with** $name
        -   $name **hate** $name
        -   $name **fight with** $name
        -   $name **gain** [treasure]
        -   $name **learn** [skill]
        -   $name **beat** $name
        -   $name **kill** $name
        -   $name **marry** $name
        -   $name **die**

    *   And we'll support boolean/String/Int like this:
    ```swift
        var isMeteor = true
        let currentChar = "wuming"
        var hp = 120
    ```

####  Sample

// test.md

```swift
    let currentChar = "吴茗"
    let currentCity = "江城"
    if currentChar.age == 20:   // 少年出山
        $currentChar move to $currentCity 
```
